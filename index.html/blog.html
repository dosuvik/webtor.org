<h1>Reason why you Need To Create A Websitet!</h1>
<p id="p">Every business needs a website so as to get more and more views. Hre are some reasons why you need a website.</p>
<b>you will need a website for:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>To Establish A Presence</b></li>
<p>OApproximately 3.4 billion people (In 2014 per the U.N.) worldwide have access to the World Wide Web (WWW). No matter what your business is, you can’t ignore 3.4 billion people. To be a part of that community and to show that you are interested in serving them, you need to be on the WWW for them. You know your competitors will be online if they are not already.</p>
<li><b>To Network</b></li>
<p>A lot of what passes for business is simply nothing more than making connections with other people. Every smart business person knows, it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Passing out your business card is part of every good meeting and every business person can tell more than one story about how a chance meeting turned into the big deal. What if you could pass out your business card to thousands, maybe millions of potential clients and partners, saying this is what I do and if you are ever in need of my services, this is how you can reach me? You can, 24 hours a day, inexpensively and simply, on the WWW.</p>
<li><b>To Make Business Information Available</b></li>
<p>What is basic business information? Think of a Yellow Pages ad. What are your hours? What do you do? How can someone contact you? What methods of payment do you take? Where are you located at? Now think of the WWW as a Yellow Pages ad where you have instant communication. What is today’s special? Today’s interest rate? Next week’s parking lot sale information? If you could keep your customer informed of every reason why they should do business with you, don’t you think you could do more business? You can on the WWW.</p>
<li><b>To Serve Your Customers</b></li>
<p>Making business information available is one of the most important ways to serve your customers. If you look at serving your customer, you’ll find even more ways to use WWW technology. How about making forms available to pre-qualify for loans, or have your staff do a search for that classic jazz record your customer is looking for, without tying up your staff on the phone to take down the information? Allow your customer to punch in sizes and check it against a database that tells him if a color of jacket is available in your store? All this can be done, simply and quickly, on the WWW.</p>
<li><b>To Heighten Public Interest</b></li>
<p>You won’t get Newsweek magazine to write up your local store opening, but you might get them to write up your Web Page address if it is something new and interesting. Even if Newsweek would write about your local store opening, you wouldn’t benefit from someone in a distant city reading about it, unless of course, they were coming to your town sometime soon. With a Web page, anybody anywhere who can access the Web and find your website is a potential customer!</p>
<li><b>To Release Time Sensitive Materials</b></li>
<p>What if your materials need to be released no earlier than midnight? The quarterly earnings statement, the grand prize winner, the press kit for the much anticipated film, the merger news? Well, you sent out the materials to the press with “The-do-not-release-before-such-and-such-time” statement and hope for the best. Now the information can be made available at midnight or anytime you specify, with all related materials such as photographs, bios, etc. released at exactly the same time. Imagine the anticipation of “All materials will be made available on our Web site at 12:01 AM”.</p>
<li><b>To Sell Things</b></li>
<p>Many people think this is the number one thing to do with the World Wide Web, but we made it number seven to make it clear that we think you should consider selling things on the Internet and the World Wide Web after you have done all the things above and maybe even after doing a few more things from this list. Why? Well, the answer is complex but the best way to put it is this: do you consider the telephone the best place to sell things? Probably not. You probably consider the telephone a tool that allows you to communicate with your customer, which in turn helps you sell things. Well, that’s how we think you should consider the WWW. The technology is different, of course, but before people decide to become customers, they want to know about you, what you do and what you can do for them. After they learn about your business, you might be able to turn them into customers.</p>
<li><b>To make pictures, sound and video available</b></li>
<p>What if your widget is great, but people would really love it if they could see it in action? The album is great but with no airplay, nobody knows that it sounds great? A picture is worth a thousand words, but you don’t have the space for a thousand words? The WWW allows you to add sound, pictures and video to your company’s information. No brochure will do that.</p>
<li><b>To reach a highly desirable demographic market</b></li>
<p>The demographic of the WWW user is probably the highest mass-market demographic available. Usually college-educated or currently in college, making a high salary or soon to make a high salary, it’s no wonder that Wired magazine, the magazine of choice to the Internet community, has no problem getting Lexus and other high-end marketers advertising. Even with the addition of the commercial on-line community, the demographic will remain high for many years to come.</p>
<li><b>To Answer Frequently Asked questions</b></li>
<p>Whoever answers the phones in your organization can tell you, their time is usually spent answering the same questions over and over again. These are the questions customers and potential customers want to know the answer to before they deal with you. Post them on an FAQ (frequently asked questions) page and you will have removed another barrier to doing business with you and free up some time for your harried phone operator.</p>
